# Wireshark package diagram

I am a fan of learning the data model of a networking protocol and then learn
about various abstractions and operations on top of that. This makes the
learning various protocols very easy. I learned today that I can view the 
package diagram in wireshark.

Step to view the package diagram:
- right click on one of the columns
- click on column preferences
- under appearences, click panes
- select package diagram
