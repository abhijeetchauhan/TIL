# I created my first Github Gist

I wanted to share the script I wrote to easily open my daily journal entry
in Neovim. I use the custom Vim command almost daily and find it to be very
useful. It is simple and does the job. And, sharing it with Github Gist was
a very straightforward process. I also learned that I can embed this code
anywhere on my website which can be useful as I am thinking to write more
long form content in the future.
